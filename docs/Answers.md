1. Likely control samples are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
2. Uncertain: Sample 3
3. Sample 3 has a raw count of 1 DSB site, 
   however when normalised this reduces to < 0.5 at 0.267. 
   So this could be a DSB site or down to chance.
   (Could resample or look at the quality of that break position).
4. Maximum percentage is around 50% in sample 11.
